What is the cybersecurity threat landscape for a startup business, that is completely virtual, working in the digital health industry and has its own SaaS platform with AI and data analytics functions, and contains PHI?

Threat Landscape
A virtual digital health startup with a SaaS AI platform handling PHI operates in a threat landscape shaped by:
Sophisticated cybercriminal groups targeting healthcare data.
State-sponsored actors interested in medical and AI research.
Hacktivists opposing AI use in healthcare or data monetisation.
Insiders (malicious or careless) within distributed teams.
Automated scanning bots probing for cloud and API vulnerabilities.
Supply chain compromises, especially in AI/ML libraries and third-party health integrations.


This landscape is dynamic, with threats evolving rapidly alongside AI, remote work, and healthcare tech trends.
